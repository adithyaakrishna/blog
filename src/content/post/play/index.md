You know that feeling when you're doing something you love and forget about time? When you're so into it that nothing else matters? That's what play feels like. And guess what? Those are the times when you do your best work.

I'm someone who loves to code and there are days I might stay up all night writing code just like many other people in tech/non-tech out there. Or an artist who's so busy drawing they skip meals. Most people would call this hard work. But these people are having fun - they're just playing and trying stuff out.

Something cool happens when we mix play with work. When we work like we're playing, we get better ideas, worry less, and do a better job. But these days, everyone tells us to work more and more. So how do we keep having fun?

It's easy - just think about work in a new way. Don't see tasks as boring things you must do. See them as chances to try new things and learn. Just ask yourself: "How can I make this fun?"

Being perfect can kill the fun. If you try too hard to do everything right, you won't try new things. It's okay to make mistakes, even in serious work. Sometimes the best ideas come from messing up (this is not to be taken as a cue to mess up more xD)

Find things that make you forget about time. Do more of what's fun in your daily life. You'll be happier and get more done. Make your work a place where you can grow and have fun.

Remember, what's fun for you might look like work to someone else. That's fine! You don't need to make everything feel like a game. Just find ways to enjoy what you do. When you bring play into your work and life, you'll do better and feel better too.
_So ask yourself_: What makes you lose track of time? How can you bring more of that playful energy into your daily life? The answers might just lead you to a more joyful and productive path.
