Everyone says FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is bad for us. But what if it's actually helpful? FOMO can push us to do better things in life. It's like having someone who keeps motivating you to improve yourself, always there in your mind (even though it can make you worry sometimes).

Here's what I mean: When you see your friend posting about working out at the gym, don't you feel like exercising too? That's FOMO helping you get active. The same thing happens when someone gets a great job or learns something new. You start looking up how to do it too.

FOMO isn't just about wanting a better body or more money. It's that little voice in your head asking "What are you doing with your life? What's next?" This voice makes you plan ahead, meet new people, and use your time better. Without it, you might not do much at all.

But remember this: FOMO isn't about copying everything others do. It's about using that feeling to improve yourself in ways that matter to you. Don't let it take over your life - instead, use it to help you (just don't try to control everything). Let it push you to become better.

So next time you feel FOMO, don't fight it. Use it to help you grow. Let it encourage you to do great things. You're in charge of your life, and FOMO is just there to remind you to make the most of it. Go ahead and do something amazing - FOMO is cheering you on.

PS. this is my first blog and I just dumped all the thoughts I had into this one `.md` file and hit `git commit` :P
